# Python_Projects
This repository contains the projects I worked on while learning Python. These projects utilize various modules such as tkinter and sqlite3.

**Django Checkbook**

This project lets the user balance a checkbook. It can add and delete accounts from the database as well as make withdrawals, deposits or check the current balance.

**Django University**

The Django university project allowed for further practice with Django and databases. It keeps track of professors, classes, and which campus location the course is taught at.

**Phonebook**

The phonebook project keeps track of entries by saving a contact's name, email address, and phone number so it acts as a working phone book for the user.

**Nice Or Mean Game**

This game keeps track of the interactions chosen (nice interactions or mean interactions). It keeps a running tally and utilizes logic to determine if the player wins or loses the game.

**Web Page Generator**

The Web Page Generator was an introduction to using the tkinter module, grid display and inheritance. It creates a default HTML page or lets the user enter their own text.
